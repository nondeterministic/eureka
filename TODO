TODO
=====

- Make game characters definable in Lua

- Problem is: coord selection and other keyboard input sometimes seems sluggish.  It's not cause the game is slow, but because
  we only redraw when TICK event occurs.  Perhaps, update effects of keyboard input immediately?

- Fix SquareArena::is_illuminated: 
  Illumination of icons doesn't work, e.g., when entering Lendom at 22:00, one can see it clearly.
  (Addendum: effect is not so bad and could even be explained somewhat in real-life. Think of fire in distance. You see the fire, but not space in between.)

IN PROGRESS
============

BUGS
=====

- Do not let players ready an item like a jimmy lock! [MED]

- When first 3 in a party of 4 die during battle, program seems to crash during battle [SEVERE]
  SOLUTION? When member dies put immediately in the back of party, so that alive members move forward.

- Inside gamecontrol::ready_item do not recreate readied items or the number of turns that a torch
  lasts will be reset each time it is unreadied/readied. (Is this fixed? CHECK!)
