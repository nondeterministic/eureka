# Eureka Demoworld rule book

First draft of a rule book for Eureka's demoworld simply named `Demoworld`.  The quintessential game elements are already outlined below.  More may follow in the future, but is, strictly speaking, not necessary to play and finish the game.

It contains some spoilers as not all items listed below are immediately obvious to the player, especially magic items.

In order to properly interpret the following tables, it will be useful to know that as far as property strengths or intensities are concerned, the following ordering is assumed: very little < some < strong < very strong.

## Bestiary

Admittedly, the following is still somewhat simplistic, since I have so far lacked the time in order to differentiate monsters towards each other a bit better.  So in all likelyhood, these values are subject to change in the future.

| Name             | Hit points  | Strength    | Luck        | Dexterity   | Experience  | Terrain       | Notes                              |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------- | 
| Balron           | 35-45 (+5)  | 5-15 (+5)   | 5-12        | 3-18        | 20          | Underground   |                                    |
| Beholder         | 30-40 (+5)  | 5-15 (+5)   | 5-12        | 3-18        | 18          | Underground   | Has deadly stare                   |
| Blue Balron      | 40-50 (+10) | 5-15 (+5)   | 3-18        | 3-18        | 28          | Underground   |                                    |
| Demon            | 35-45 (+5)  | 25-35 (+5)  | 3-18        | 10-18       | 30          | Underground   | Curses the player                  |

## Edibles

Some things you can eat in the game (mostly plants and exotic flowers), and an idea of what happens, if you do.  This can be useful, for example, if you are about to starve in the wilderness or need some healing when no spell or potion is at hand...
